An Invoice creator project built with React. Add itemized items, configure quantity, prices, tax rates and discounts. Download Invoice as PDFs to your device. Uses [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react) to capture the data from the modal and covert it from canvas -> pdf.

## What's New?

- You can also add Multiple Invoices, can update old generated Invoices.
- You can copy any old invoices - saving your time.
- Delete the Invoices you no longer needed.
